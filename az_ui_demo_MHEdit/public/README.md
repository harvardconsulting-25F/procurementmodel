# Public Assets

Place the Harvard Undergraduate Consulting Group logo image here as `logo.png`.

The logo will be automatically served from the root path `/logo.png`.

**Instructions:**
1. Place your logo image file in this `public/` folder
2. Name it `logo.png` (or update the src in Logo.tsx if using a different name/format)
3. The component will automatically display it

Recommended logo size: at least 200px height for best quality on high-DPI displays.
